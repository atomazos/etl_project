## NFL Roster and Gameday Data (2009-2013)
The objective of this project is to initially extract National Football League (“NFL”) data from at least two different sources, then transform such data into a comprehensible and usable format, followed by loading the data into a central database. Although there seems to be numerous sources for NFL data, the dearth of free and publicly accessible data sources is a major stumbling block for the interested fanbase, like us, in performing significant football analytics. Be that as it may, we found NFL data from two different sources with which we created a useful postgresSQL database composed of two tables comprising player and gameday data for the 2009 – 2013 seasons.
